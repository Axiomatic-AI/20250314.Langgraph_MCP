Below is an illustrative example of how MCP integration might appear in a project like [open_deep_research](https://github.com/langchain-ai/open_deep_research). In this scenario, you’d use an MCP adapter to automatically load and convert MCP‑defined tools into LangChain (or LangGraph)‑compatible tools. For instance, you might have an MCP server that exposes a “search_academic” tool. The adapter would fetch that tool definition and wrap it into a LangChain Tool. Here’s a simplified Python snippet:

```python
from langchain.tools import Tool
from mcp_sdk import MCPClient  # Hypothetical MCP Python SDK

# Instantiate the MCP client pointing to a server hosting your tools
mcp_client = MCPClient(server_url="http://localhost:8000")

# Fetch available MCP tools from the server (e.g., for academic paper search)
mcp_tools = mcp_client.get_tools()  # Returns list of tool definitions in JSON

# Convert MCP tools to LangChain-compatible tools
langchain_tools = []
for tool_def in mcp_tools:
    # Each tool_def might look like:
    # { "name": "search_academic", "description": "Search for academic papers.", "input_schema": {...} }
    def tool_func(input_text, tool_name=tool_def["name"]):
        # Call the MCP tool (this function wraps the actual RPC call)
        return mcp_client.call_tool(tool_name, {"query": input_text})
    langchain_tools.append(
        Tool(
            name=tool_def["name"],
            func=tool_func,
            description=tool_def["description"]
        )
    )

# Now these langchain_tools can be integrated into the research assistant workflow,
# allowing an LLM to call them as part of the planning or report generation steps.
```

In this example, the MCP adapter acts as a bridge—fetching standardized tool definitions from an MCP server and converting them into a format that [open_deep_research](https://github.com/langchain-ai/open_deep_research) (via LangChain or LangGraph) can immediately use. This reduces the boilerplate for integrating external tools and makes it easier for non‑developers to plug in new capabilities.

This approach is aligned with recent discussions and implementations in the ecosystem—for example, the LangChain MCP Adapters package simplifies this conversion process, enabling seamless integration of hundreds of MCP‑compliant tool servers into agentic flows.
